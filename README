FizzBuzz …and Embedded Domain Specific Languages — obviously.

A couple of slides and code to illustrate Maciej Piróg's article “FizzBuzz
in Haskell  by Embedding a  Domain-Specific Language” as published  in The
Monad.Reader Issue 23, April 23, 2014¹.

The article is available in PDF form in:

    TheMonadReader-Issue23-FizzBuzz.pdf

The slides used in a workplace lightning talk are available in:

    Slides-FizzBuzzDSL.pdf

The code  is mostly a transcription  of Maciej's work in  the article, and
thus (as with the included article) The Monad.Reader's licencing terms ap-
ply. The slides are covered by Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0².
